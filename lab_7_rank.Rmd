Hi this is Nakoa and I am your creator!

Collaborators (it's rachel and I'm a collaborator)

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

```


ahh shh push it:


Is there a significant difference in pre-talk hermit scores for females and males? 

Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U (wilcox.test unpaired)
```{r}
mwu_kermit = kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)
mwu_kermit
```
... there is no significant difference between gender in pre-talk hermit scores.
